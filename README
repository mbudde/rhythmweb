  Rhythmweb - a web site for your Rhythmbox.
  Copyright (C) 2007 Michael Gratton.

Rhythmweb lets you control Rhythmbox <http://www.gnome.org/projects/rhythmbox/>
remotely, from your web browser. It is not an Internet radio server - it does
not play music in your web browser, rather it lets you control Rhythmbox
on a machine other than the one it is running on.

Rhythmweb was inspired by Joe Shaw's Banshee Media Server, which /is/ a
Internet radio server.

For more information and the latest releases, go to the Rhythmweb
web site: <http://web.vee.net/projects/rhythmweb>

  Requirements

To use Rhythmweb, you must have the following installed:

 - Rhythmbox v0.11 (v0.10 might work)
 - Python 2.5.

  Installation

To install Rhythmweb, copy the `rhythmweb' directory to
`~/.gnome2/rhythmbox/plugins', start Rhythmbox, go to the Edit > Plugins...
menu and check the Enabled checkbox for Rhythmweb.

Then browse to the machine running on port 8000, eg: http://you-rb-host:8080/

  TODO

Things I'm planning on doing (patches greatly appreciated).

 - Playlist editing
 - AJAX bling
 - Configurable port number, etc
 - Login-based security, public version of the player
 - REST web services API
 - Support an alternative wsgiref (to support older versions of Python)
