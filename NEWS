Overview of changes in Rhythmweb 0.4
====================================

* publish player URL using mDNS (a.k.a Rendezvous, Bonjour, Zeroconf)
  so it shows up in Epiphany's Bookmarks > Nearby Sites menu
* chrome changes to make RW look more like RB
* play the first entry from the play queue if nothing is already playing
* refresh when the song should end so the details get updated
* display a basic play queue


Feel free to send me some screenshots of RW next to RB using different themes
so I can get an idea of what it looks like (or how much it sucks) using Your
Favourite Theme.

Overview of changes in Rhythmweb 0.3
====================================

* display the title, artist and album when playing from a stream
* updated now-playing text style to match RB
* use UTF-8 for player HTTP response
* redirect request logging to RB's debug log, to enable, run RB
  with -D rhythmweb
* make titles on player toolbar buttons actually show up as tooltips

And some other assorted bug fixes. Thanks to Jonathan Matthew for a
whole lot of patches.
